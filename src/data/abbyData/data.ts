  <p>
    Hey, I'm Abby, a full-stack developer. I love building things that people and I myself genuinely use and love. Currently I'm working on - <a href="https://app.okito.dev/" target="_blank"> <strong>Okito</strong> </a> a next-generation Web3 payment gateway and SDK built on Solana.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides programming, I'm passionate about football and video games. I also love music and movies - they're a huge part of my life and inspiration. When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing Valorant, watching football matches, or discovering new music and films.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have an idea and would like to collaborate, feel free to DM me! I'm always open and ready to connect and work on exciting projects. Also, be sure to check out my other side, just click on the navbar image!
